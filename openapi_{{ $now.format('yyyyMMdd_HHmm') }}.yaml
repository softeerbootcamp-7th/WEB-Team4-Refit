  title: Interview Application API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    This OpenAPI specification defines the API for an interview preparation application.
    It includes DTO (Data Transfer Object) definitions and example API usage.

    **Discussions/Notes from Requirements:**
    *   **JSON Key Naming Convention:** The Java DTOs use `camelCase` (e.g., `associationId`, `associationName`). It is assumed that the JSON request/response bodies will also follow `camelCase`. This needs to be formally decided.
    *   **Terminology Consistency:** Ensure consistent Korean wording for "frequent qna set".
        *   "많이" (Many/Most) appeared 2 times (e.g., "가장 많이 나온 질문 TOP6").
        *   "자주" (Frequent) appeared 4 times (e.g., "면접에서 자주 나온 질문", "자주 나오는 면접 질문", "자주 나오는 카테고리", "자주 나오는 인성 질문").
        *   "빈출" (Frequently appearing) appeared 12 times (e.g., "빈출 카테고리", "유사 면접 빈출 질문", "내 면접 빈출 질문", "주요 직무 빈출").
        *   Recommendation: Standardize on one term, likely "빈출 면접 질문" or "자주 나오는 면접 질문" for consistency across the application.
